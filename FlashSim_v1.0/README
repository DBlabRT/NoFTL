PAGE: 
	so far there are a lot of kernel functions using this term in their names (e.g., allocate_page, free_page, etc.) and to avoid confusions we
	with other terms that also could be defined as "pages", withing this project we define the PAGE as:
	access unit of main memory of PC (usually 4 Kb).
	=> names like: page_idx, page_offset, PAGE_SHIFT... all refere to main memory page (that is from PC architecture given)

KERNEL_SECTOR:
	linux kernel sees all block devices as a contiguous sequence of 512 bytes blocks (independent of internal (physical) structure of device,
	size of its internal access unit etc. => always blocks in size of 512 bytes	). Everywhere, where the word sector comes following the word
	kernel we mean 512 byte area of memory (the only one exception is the kernel type sector_t = it is used to describe the index of kernel sectors). 
	There, where the word "sector" comes without word "kernel" we are talking about "NAND PAGE" (see next definition).		

SECTOR:
	This is the "NAND PAGE" = "... the smallest addressable unit for read and program operations of NAND memory." AS already said only to avoid
	collisions with "main memory page" we will call this as SECTOR
	
BLOCK:
	Minimal eraseable unit of NAND memory
