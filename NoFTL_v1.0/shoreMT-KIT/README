1. Installing
-----------------------

a. Prerequisites
-----------------------

- Download and compile Shore-mt. 

- Link ~/apps/shore to the base dir for shore-mt

#> ln -s <shore-mt-dir> ~/apps/shore 

b. Compiling
-----------------------

#> ./autogen.sh
#> CXX=CC ./configure
#> gmake -j

NOTE: It is also possible to configure shore-kits to use an arbitrary
      copy of shore-mt by configuring SHORE_HOME as an argument to the
      configure

#> CXX=CC ./configure SHORE_HOME=<shore-mt-dir>


NOTE: We know of no reason shore-kits should not run on any posix
      platform, but shore-mt currently supports only on 64-bit sparc
      solaris so we have not tested anywhere else.

-----------------------
2. Running
-----------------------

a. Edit shore.conf
-----------------------

In order to populate a new database set db-clobberdev=1. 
(if opening an already populated database set db-clobberdev=0.)
Follow instructions at shore.conf.



b. Run shore_kits
-----------------------

#> ./shore_kits



c. List of commands
-----------------------

i. The three basic commands for running experiments:

measure - Executes a specific workload for a specific duration.
          The user can set the number of clients, whether the requests will be spread, the
          number of iterations, and the scaling factor.


test    - For a specific workload each client executes a specific number of transactions.
          The user can set the number of clients, whether the requests will be spread, the
          number of iterations, and the scaling factor.
          WARNING: The 'test' command is innacurate in terms of the reported throughput.

trxs    - Lists the transactions supported by the current workload.



ii. Additional commands:

break   - Breaks into a debugger by raising ^C (terminates program if no debugger is active)
cpu     - Process cpu usage/statitics
echo    - Echoes its input arguments to the screen
help    - Prints help
iodelay - Sets the fake I/O disk delay
quit    - Quits
stats   - Print statistics
trace   - Sets tracing level


iii. Help:

help     - Prints the list of additional commands 
help cmd - Prints cmd-specific information 



c. Usage example:
-----------------------

Assuming a 10wh TPC-C database.

- Execute 5 iterations of 1min runs of 20 clients running the TPC-C Mix.

(tpcc-base) measure 10 0 20 60 0 5 0


- Run 2 iterations of 30secs runs of 10 clients submitting only TPC-C NewOrder 
  transactions, and each client uses a different warehouse.

(tpcc-base) measure 10 1 10 30 2 1 




-----------------------
3. Notes
-----------------------

a. Re-populate a database:
-----------------------

In case of errors during powerruns, it is faster to re-populate a new database 
than wait for recovery to finish. Shore when it starts always first tries
to recover. Therefore, before the re-population of a benchmark database the log 
files should be deleted.

- Set db-clobberdev=1 at shore.conf
- Delete any log files at the corresponding log directory (files at <db-config>-log dir)
- Run shore_kits
- Reset db-clobberdev=0 *before* re-running shore_kits



-----------------------
4. Known Bugs
-----------------------

BUG-1: Cannot update fields included at indexes - delete and insert again.

BUG-2: Only the last field of an index can be of variable length
